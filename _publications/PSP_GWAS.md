title: "Genetic, transcriptomic, histological, and biochemical analysis of progressive supranuclear palsy implicates glial activation and novel risk genes"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/PSP_GWAS
excerpt: 'This genome-wide study identifies six PSP risk loci, including a novel C4A locus, with evidence of oligodendrocyte-specific effects. The C4A gene’s increased copy number and complement deposition may play a key role, revealing genetic mechanisms that differentiate PSP from Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s'
